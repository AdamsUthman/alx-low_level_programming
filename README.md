The folders in this repository provide an example of a fundamental programming idea that is unique to the C programming language. The concepts are mentioned in the file names (i.e. pointers, recursion, malloc, free, structures, function pointers, variadic functions, linked lists, etc) These directories contain files with bash scripts and functions related to that specific idea. Some functions (such as _strcpy, _strlen, etc.) are copies of counterparts available in the C standard libraries.
